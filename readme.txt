Code that generated my osu! storyboard demo (see link in repo description).

As this is a demo, the code was not exactly written to be nice or readable.  No effort was made into writing 'good' code as this is not meant to be modified or used after it's done.  Some parts can be reused though.

Check the releases page to find pre generated storyboards.
